# RAG System for Disease Diagnosis

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for clinical diagnosis, leveraging FAISS for document retrieval and advanced LLMs for answer generation. 
I developed and completed this project in April 2025, successfully deploying it on Hugging Face for public access. Following comprehensive evaluation and feedback from my professor, 
I fully updated the pipeline in May 2025, enhancing retrieval precision, optimizing generation with models like Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and incorporating robust error analysis and 
user simulation. The system now delivers accurate, context-aware responses for medical queries, with detailed performance metrics and a focus on clinical relevance.
